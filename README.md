# FleetController
A simple ROS2 + MAVROS project for controlling a fleet of three UAVs.
This controller allows you to:

Set flight modes directly from the terminal

Command takeoff, landing, and offboard control

Send position/velocity setpoints to move the drones

Manage multiple UAVs in a basic fleet setup
